My project serves me to discover new formula for air traffic control. It is created for gathering data about angles and distances changes while aircraft is moving.
The formula should include universal proportion between distance and angle.

This is an expiremental route calculator, which determines moving object trajectory, depending on change distance of known route. 
For calculation a special reference frame is emplemented, allowing to track object movement via special parameters.
